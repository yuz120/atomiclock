        <p>
            I have seen my idealized version of myself broken to pieces several times in my 22 years of life. 
            I usually escaped, then forgot about it, and started newâ€”minimizing the impact of my past memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have not worked hard enough. This is an objective truth. Whenever I say so, people tell me I did. 
            But I always know I did not.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> I never did the practice exams properly. I have never aced exams just through one endeavor...
        </p>
        <p>
            Nothing is perfect, which is why I cry when I first begin to write the opening paragraph. 
            It never proceeds to the next phase.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only perfect thing is my family and childhood. My city is perfect. Yes, Shanghai is perfect.
